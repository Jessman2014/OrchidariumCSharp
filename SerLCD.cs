     serLCD.cpp - Library for controlling a SparkFun serLCD
                  module.
	          Code written for firmware version 2.5
     Created by Cody B. Null, September 9, 2011
     Modified by Jordan Hochenbaum, Dec 5, 2011. (Version 1.5)
     Version 1.4 - This version wrote specifically for 16x2
                   Display.
                   More display support coming in later version.
     Version 1.5 - Since mid 2011 the Arduino IDE has implemented the NewSoftSerial 
                    library updates in the standard SoftwareSerial library and so 
                    using NewSoftSerial is no longer needed. serLCD has been updated 
                    to use the Standard SoftwareSerial library. Also, Arduino 1.0
                    support has been added. Backwards compatible with previous versions.
 
     Note -	This library requires NewSoftSerial library
     The latest version of NewSoftSerial library can 
     always be found at http://arduiniana.org. -> NO LONGER NECESSARY. See V1.5 notes above
